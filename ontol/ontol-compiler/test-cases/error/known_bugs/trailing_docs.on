// BUG: a doc comment expects a def, rel, fmt or map to follow, // ERROR parse error: expected one of `def`, `rel`, `fmt`, `map`
// but having a commented-out section at the end can occur during deveopment.
// This can get very confusing, as the compiler doesn't know where to put the error,
// and it's really hard to understand what's going on.

def foo ()

/// test
// def bar ()
