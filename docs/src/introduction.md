# Introduction

ONTOL (ONTOlogy Language) is a declarative language for domain modelling, expressing abstract and concrete types, how they relate to other types, and how types map to one another. It allows you to develop and document an ontology from its most basic concepts and structures, which can then be compiled and interacted with through the Memoriam domain engine.
