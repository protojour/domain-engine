# Introduction

ONTOL (ONTOlogy Language) is a declarative language for domain modelling, expressing abstract and concrete concepts and data structures, how they relate to other concepts, and how structures map to one another. It allows you to develop and document an ontology from its most basic roots, which can then be compiled and interacted with through the Memoriam domain engine.
