# Domains

A collection of related concepts is known as a ***domain***.

Every ONTOL (`.on`) file describes a single domain. Domains may depend on other domains through [`use` imports](use.md).

Here's a simple example domain:

```ontol
def book (
    rel .'id'|id: (rel .is: serial)
    rel .'title': text
    rel {.}'author': {author}
    rel .'editions': {edition}
)

def author (
    rel .'id'|id: (rel .is: serial)
    rel .'name': text
    rel .'nationality': world.country
    rel .'born': datetime
    rel .'died'?: datetime
)

def edition (
    rel .'id'|id: (rel .is: serial)
    rel .'publisher': publisher
    rel .'published': datetime
    rel .'isbn': text
    rel .'pages': i64
)

def publisher (
    rel .'id'|id: (rel .is: serial)
    rel .'name': text
    rel .'headquarters': world.city
)
```

Notice how `world.country` and `world.city` are borrowed from a different domain. We wouldn't want to include _every_ tangentially related concept in our "books" domain, as countries and cities have very little to do with books.

A domain is reusable, and gets better the more you work on it. Remember to document the domain using [doc comments](comments.md#doc-comments).


## Ontologies

A collection of domains is called an ***ontology*** (from greek; _'the study of being'_ or of _'that which is'_), and represents a complete world view â€“ for a given use case. While many formal ontologies actually try to represent a _complete_ world view, it probably is not a requirement in yours.

The ONTOL compiler may take in many domains, and the binary produces is also called an ontology.
