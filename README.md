# ONTOL

A proof of concept domain description and mapping language.

The name is a silly spin on ALGOL (for algorithms!), this is a language for ontologies.

We'll try to keep things simple where we can.
The simplest syntactical "framework" is S-expressions (with a bracket extension) so that's what we'll at least start with.
